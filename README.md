## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Details

To create this project I used the `ipify` API to be able to access data such as longitude, latitude, city etc...

I created an environment variable in an .env file called `API_IPIFY_KEY` that will store my `ipify` API key

to add this environment variable to the project just create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project and place the following code inside the `.env.local` file:
```
API_IPIFY_KEY="<YOUR_KEY>"
```
